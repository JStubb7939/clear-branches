Productivy and easy way to clear your local branches *(This library is not finished yet, it isn't working well)*

## WIP
- [x] Setup to run using `clear-branches` or `npx clear-branches`
- [ ] Setup to run cross environment (unix or windows) platforms, [shelljs](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs) could be a good solution
- [ ] Code improvement, it's a messy today, sorry.
- [ ] Security improvement using Deno.
